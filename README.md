# Power BI Practice Projects

This repository contains hands-on Power BI practice projects focused on developing skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboard design for analytics and business intelligence use cases.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to simulate real-world analytics scenarios using sample datasets and Power BI reports. Each project is designed to:
- Frame a simple business problem or question
- Build a clean and efficient data model
- Define meaningful KPIs and metrics using DAX
- Design clear, interactive report pages for stakeholders

As new projects are created, they will be added as separate folders with their own Power BI files and assets.

## Tools and technologies

- Power BI Desktop for report development
- Power Query for data loading and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for measures and calculated columns
- Excel/CSV files and other compatible sources as datasets

These tools are used to practice a complete end-to-end workflow from raw data to insightful dashboards.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized to keep each practice project modular and easy to explore:

```text
POWERBI-PRACTISE/
  ├── Project_Name_1/
  │   ├── Project_Name_1.pbix
  │   ├── data/
  │   └── images/
  ├── Project_Name_2/
  │   ├── Project_Name_2.pbix
  │   ├── data/
  │   └── images/
  └── README.md
```

For each project folder (for example, Sales Analysis, HR Analytics, Finance Dashboard), the following files are typically included:
- `.pbix`: Main Power BI report
- `data/`: Raw and/or processed datasets (if shareable)
- `images/`: Screenshots of key report pages and visuals

## How to view the reports

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired project folder.
3. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
4. Interact with filters, slicers, and visuals on each report page to explore the analysis.

If datasets are included, they can be examined separately in the `data` folder for additional practice in Power Query or other tools.

## Learning objectives

This repository supports continuous learning and portfolio building in:
- Practical Power BI report development
- Data transformation and modeling best practices
- Writing robust and reusable DAX measures
- Storytelling with data through well-structured dashboards

The projects here are intended to help prepare for entry-level roles in data analytics and business intelligence by practicing with realistic reporting scenarios.
